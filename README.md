# Hyperliquid Fibonacci Trading Bot

This project is a complete, three-part automated trading signal and execution system for the Hyperliquid DEX. It uses a Fibonacci-based strategy to identify potential long entries, displays the data on a web dashboard, and executes trades based on the generated signals.

***

## How It Works

The system is composed of three core Python scripts that must be run simultaneously in separate terminal windows:

1.  **`collector.py`**: This script acts as the data pipeline. It connects to the Hyperliquid API, fetches the price of a configured asset (e.g., SOL) every 60 seconds, and appends the timestamped price to a local `price_data.json` file.

2.  **`app.py`**: This is a web dashboard built with Dash. It reads the raw data from `price_data.json`, processes it into 5-minute OHLC candlestick data, calculates rolling Fibonacci support and resistance levels, and displays everything on an interactive chart. It also manages the state logic for generating trade signals.

3.  **`trade.py`**: This is the execution bot. It continuously monitors a `trade_signals.json` file generated by `app.py`. When a valid "buy" signal is detected, it connects to the Hyperliquid exchange, places a market order for a pre-configured size, and logs the transaction to `trade_log.json`.

## File Descriptions

-   `collector.py`: Fetches 1-minute price data and saves it.
-   `app.py`: Runs the Dash web server, calculates indicators, and generates trade signals.
-   `trade.py`: Executes trades
-   `trade_bot.py`: Runs the trade bot that reads from the .json
-   `example_utils.py`: A utility file for connecting to the Hyperliquid SDK.
-   `price_data.json`: Stores the raw, 1-minute price data.
-   `trade_signals.json`: Stores the latest calculated signal. This file is read by `trade.py`.
-   `trade_log.json`: A log of all trade attempts made by `trade.py`.
-   `main.py`: Will launch all processes in tmux detached terminals in the correct order.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Create a file named `requirements.txt` with the following content:

```
dash
pandas
plotly
numpy
hyperliquid-python-sdk
```

Then, install the packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configuration
-   **`collector.py` & `app.py`**: Open these files and ensure the `COIN_TO_TRACK` variable is set to the desired asset (e.g., "SOL").
-   **`trade_bot.py`**: Open this file and set the `TRADE_USD_SIZE` variable to your desired trade amount in USD.

# ðŸš€ System Startup & Management

This trading bot system is composed of four distinct processes that must run simultaneously. To simplify management, a `main.py` script is provided to launch, monitor, and manage all components within separate `tmux` sessions.

### Starting the System

The `main.py` script is the primary entry point for running the entire bot system. It will automatically check for running processes and only start the components that are not currently active.

1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2.  Run the manager script:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```
3.  The manager will launch all four scripts (`collector.py`, `app.py`, `trade_bot.py`, and `discord_bot.py`) in their own detached `tmux` sessions and begin monitoring them.

---
### Monitoring Processes

Once the system is running, you can "attach" to any of the `tmux` sessions to view the live log output for that specific script. This is essential for debugging and monitoring.

* **List all running sessions:**
    ```bash
    tmux list-sessions
    ```
* **View the output of a specific process:**
    ```bash
    # To view the price data collector
    tmux attach -t collector

    # To view the signal generator (app.py)
    tmux attach -t dashboard

    # To view the trading bot's actions
    tmux attach -t tradebot

    # To view the Discord bot's activity
    tmux attach -t discordbot
    ```
* **To detach from a session** without stopping it, press `Ctrl+B` then `D`.

---
### Stopping the System

The manager provides a simple command to shut down all related `tmux` sessions cleanly.

* To stop all four processes, run:
    ```bash
    python3 main.py stop
    ```
