# Hyperliquid Fibonacci Trading Bot

This project is a complete, three-part automated trading signal and execution system for the Hyperliquid DEX. It uses a Fibonacci-based strategy to identify potential long entries, displays the data on a web dashboard, and executes trades based on the generated signals.

***

## How It Works

The system is composed of three core Python scripts that must be run simultaneously in separate terminal windows:

1.  **`collector.py`**: This script acts as the data pipeline. It connects to the Hyperliquid API, fetches the price of a configured asset (e.g., SOL) every 60 seconds, and appends the timestamped price to a local `price_data.json` file.

2.  **`app.py`**: This is a web dashboard built with Dash. It reads the raw data from `price_data.json`, processes it into 5-minute OHLC candlestick data, calculates rolling Fibonacci support and resistance levels, and displays everything on an interactive chart. It also manages the state logic for generating trade signals.

3.  **`trade.py`**: This is the execution bot. It continuously monitors a `trade_signals.json` file generated by `app.py`. When a valid "buy" signal is detected, it connects to the Hyperliquid exchange, places a market order for a pre-configured size, and logs the transaction to `trade_log.json`.

## File Descriptions

-   `collector.py`: Fetches 1-minute price data and saves it.
-   `app.py`: Runs the Dash web server, calculates indicators, and generates trade signals.
-   `trade.py`: Executes trades based on the signals from `app.py`.
-   `example_utils.py`: A utility file for connecting to the Hyperliquid SDK.
-   `price_data.json`: Stores the raw, 1-minute price data.
-   `trade_signals.json`: Stores the latest calculated signal. This file is read by `trade.py`.
-   `trade_log.json`: A log of all trade attempts made by `trade.py`.

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Create a file named `requirements.txt` with the following content:

```
dash
pandas
plotly
numpy
hyperliquid-python-sdk
```

Then, install the packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Configuration
-   **`collector.py` & `app.py`**: Open these files and ensure the `COIN_TO_TRACK` variable is set to the desired asset (e.g., "SOL").
-   **`trade.py`**: Open this file and set the `TRADE_USD_SIZE` variable to your desired trade amount in USD.

## How to Run the Bot

You must run the three main scripts in the correct order from three separate terminals. Make sure your virtual environment is activated in each terminal.

**Terminal 1: Start the Data Collector**
```bash
python collector.py
```
*Leave this running. It will start creating `price_data.json`.*

**Terminal 2: Start the Dash App**
```bash
python app.py
```
*This will start the web server. You can view the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8050/. Once it has enough data, it will create `trade_signals.json`.*

**Terminal 3: Start the Trading Bot**
```bash
python trade.py
```
*This bot will now monitor `trade_signals.json` and execute trades when a signal appears.*
